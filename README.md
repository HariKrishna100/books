## About

The code examples in this repository were tested with Python 3.8, though other Python versions should work in most cases.

This repository introduces core concepts and tools essential for data engineering, including:
- Data Architecture and Infrastructure
- Data Modeling and Design
- ETL Processes and Data Pipelines
- Data Storage and Processing
- Data Quality and Governance
- Scalability and Performance Optimization

Familiarity with Python and SQL is assumed. For a quick introduction to Python, consider reviewing [Python's official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/).

See [Index.ipynb](notebooks/Index.ipynb) for an index of the notebooks available to accompany the text.

## Software

The code in this repository was tested with Python 3.8, though most examples should also work with Python 3.6+.

The packages used to run the code are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). To install the requirements using pip, run the following at the command-line:
